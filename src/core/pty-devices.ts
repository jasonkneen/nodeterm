 * macOS caps pty devices system-wide at `kern.tty.ptmx_max` (511 by default), and with 62 live app
 * PTYs, 18 tmux sessions and ~19 ssh children there were 515 `/dev/ttys*` entries. Every spawn from
 * then on failed with a bare `posix_spawnp failed.` — the SAME opaque error a cross-arch
 * spawn-helper produces, which is why the old message sent the report chasing an architecture that
 * was fine.
 *
 * `null` means "could not be measured", which is a different statement from zero and is rendered as
 * silence rather than as a number (same rule as `SpawnResources`).
