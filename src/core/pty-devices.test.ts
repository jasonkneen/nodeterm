/**
 * The 2026-08-11 report: every new terminal spawned black with `posix_spawnp failed.` while the
 * spawn-helper's architecture was fine and the process was nowhere near its descriptor limit. What
 * was actually full was the MACHINE: `kern.tty.ptmx_max` is 511 and there were 515 `/dev/ttys*`
 * devices. The message named the architecture anyway — the one hint that could not be the cause —
 * and the user rebuilt node-pty for the third time.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the ORDER of the hints and the fact that the pty-device hint is only
 * spoken when the two numbers say so.
