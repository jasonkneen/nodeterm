   * Deliberate limits, because this is the smallest honest fix and not the real one:
   *  - it is IN-MEMORY, so it dies with the core process. Co-attach means one core with N clients
   *    (Server Edition / relay), so it covers every co-viewer for as long as that core lives — but
   *    after a server restart the resurrection is back.
   *  - it is BOUNDED, in size and in time (TOMBSTONE_MAX / TOMBSTONE_TTL_MS): the key comes verbatim
   *    off the wire and an entry is recorded even when no live session exists, so an unbounded map
   *    would grow with client input alone. Eviction degrades to the pre-tombstone behavior, never
   *    worse.
   *  - it is keyed by the DESTROYER, who is exempt: their own ⌘Z (undo of a delete) must still
   *    restore the node, and a solo user is always the destroyer, so their path is untouched.
   *  - a `recycle` (worktree move) explicitly CLEARS it: nothing was deleted there.
   * Stage 3's canvas-delete mutation now removes the node from every ATTACHED client's canvas, so
   * that client never asks to re-create it — but it did not retire this map. Two paths still reach
   * `create` for a deleted node: a whole PROJECT deleted by one client is not synced (project
   * lifecycle is not in the mutation vocabulary), and a client that was disconnected when the delete
   * landed never receives it (no join snapshot, no replay). See docs/team-presence.md
