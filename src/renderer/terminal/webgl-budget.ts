/**
 * Module-level WebGL context BUDGET coordinator.
 *
 * Chromium caps live WebGL contexts per process at ~16. When a page tries to exceed that cap the
 * browser force-EVICTS an existing context to make room — and that victim is sometimes a context
 * belonging to a terminal the user is currently looking at, which then paints as Chromium's
 * "lost context" dead-canvas placeholder (a white box with a sad-face icon) until our own
 * `onContextLoss` → dispose → DOM-fallback lands a beat later.
 *
 * The per-node IntersectionObserver decisions (acquire when visible, release after a delay when
 * hidden) are each individually correct but globally UN-coordinated: a fast pan across a
 * 30-terminal canvas, or zooming out past ~16 visible terminals, momentarily OVERSHOOTS the cap —
 * nodes panned away from keep their context for the release delay while newly visible nodes each
 * acquire immediately — so the browser force-evicts, and the dead placeholder flashes.
 *
 * This coordinator keeps the number of contexts WE hold at or under `WEBGL_BUDGET`, which sits
 * comfortably below the browser cap. If we never exceed it ourselves, the browser never has to
 * force-evict anyone, so the dead placeholder cannot appear. The coordinator owns ALL timing and
 * the grant decision; the per-node `acquire`/`release` callbacks stay dumb and idempotent.
 *
 * Grant rules:
 *  - A client that becomes visible is granted only after a short ACQUIRE DEBOUNCE
 *    (`WEBGL_ACQUIRE_DEBOUNCE_MS`), so a fast pan sweeping a node across the viewport for a couple
 *    of frames never acquires. (`rootMargin` on the observer already pre-announces approach.)
 *  - If granting would exceed the budget, the coordinator immediately RECLAIMS from the
 *    least-recently-visible HIDDEN holder (bypassing that holder's release delay). If every holder
 *    is currently visible (zoomed way out), the newcomer is NOT granted and stays on the DOM
 *    renderer. Either way we never push past the budget, so the browser never force-evicts.
 *  - A client that becomes hidden keeps its context for `WEBGL_RELEASE_DELAY_MS` (warm for a
 *    pan-back) but is the first reclaim candidate during that window.
 *  - `acquire()` returning false (WebGL2 unavailable / threw) does not count against the budget.
 *  - A context lost from outside (the addon's own `onContextLoss`) is reported via
 *    `handle.contextLost()`: the grant is dropped from the accounting, and for a STILL-VISIBLE
 *    client ONE budget-gated re-grant attempt is scheduled (`WEBGL_REACQUIRE_AFTER_LOSS_MS`).
 *    Sleep/wake GPU resets lose EVERY context at once while nothing changes visibility — without
 *    the re-grant, a woken machine's terminals sat on the DOM renderer indefinitely (the
 *    "fallback feel": different cursor/scroll rendering) until the user happened to pan them out
 *    and back. This is NOT the per-node self-re-acquire loop the old "never re-grant" rule
 *    feared: the attempt goes through `tryGrant`, which never exceeds the budget and never
 *    reclaims a visible holder, so re-granting clients cannot evict each other; and repeated
 *    losses (`WEBGL_LOSS_STREAK_MAX`) stop the attempts until the next visibility transition —
 *    a genuinely unstable GPU degrades to the DOM renderer exactly as before.

 * terminals black (see TerminalNode's swap safety net).
 *
 * While the latch is on, every would-be swap is parked in `owed`; when the canvas comes to
 * REST the drain executes them a few per tick (`WEBGL_SWAPS_PER_DRAIN` / `WEBGL_DRAIN_MS`), so
